# Draw the magic line of a magic square

Uses SVG to draw the magic line traced by joining the integers of a magic square of order `n` in a sequence from `0-(n^2)-1`.

- accepts a string of numbers only if separated by **single spaces** (not double)
- accepts magic square strings where the lowest integer is either `0` or `1`

## Further development

Fix errors caused by strings without a single space separating numbers:

- remove non-numeric characters
- remove returns, line feeds
- remove duplicate spaces
