# Draw the magic line of a magic square

Uses SVG to draw the [magic line]() traced by joining the integers of a magic square of order `n` in a sequence from `0-(n^2)-1`.

- accepts a string of numbers only if separated by **single spaces** (not double)
- accepts magic square strings where the lowest integer is either `0` or `1`

## TO DO: magic square checking

- [ ] remove non-numeric characters
- [ ] remove returns, line feeds
- [ ] remove duplicate spaces
- [ ] fix errors caused by strings without a single space separating numbers

## TO DO: interface

- [ ] swap between multi and single square
- [x] set padding between squares
- [ ] set size of squares
